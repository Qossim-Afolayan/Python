#Before accumuating:
"""
1. What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result? 
It could be a range of numbers, the letters in a string, 
or some existing list that you have just as a list of names.
"""
"""
2. What type of value will you accumulate? If your final result will be a number,
your accumulator will start out with a number and 
always have a number even as it is updated each time. Similarly, 
if your final result will be a list, start with a list.
If your final result will be a string, youâ€™ll probably want to start with a string;
one other option is to accumulate a list of strings and 
then use the .join() method at the end to concatenate them all together.
